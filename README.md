# Etc2Comp - Texture to ETC2 compressor

Etc2Comp is a command line tool that converts textures (e.g. bitmaps)
into the ETC2 format. The tool is built with a focus on encoding performance
to reduce the amount of time required to compile asset heavy applications as
well as reduce overall application size.

library published as-is.
